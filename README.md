# ABAP Test Isolation Examples
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/abap-test-isolation-examples)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/abap-test-isolation-examples)

This repository contains examples for all currently available test isolation tools in the ABAP Platform. 

## The Idea
The idea of this repository is to show how to use any test environment, helper class and some common design patterns that help with isolating your code under test from its depended-on components.

## How To Use This Repository
If you want to isolate your code under test from the components it uses, you need to take a look at what your depended-on component is. Each isolation technique for a specific kind of depended-on component is used separate test class of the global class ZATI_CL_CODE_UNDER_TEST. 
The table below shows which test class uses which tool to isolate against which kind of depended-on component.
